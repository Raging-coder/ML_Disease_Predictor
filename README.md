# ML_Disease_Predictor
A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of three different types of diseases: diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease. 🏥

🔬 To achieve the highest accuracy, I experimented with various machine learning models. 🧪

🚀 To make the model accessible and user-friendly, I deployed it using Streamlit. Streamlit is an easy-to-use framework that seamlessly integrates with the Python ecosystem. It allows for rapid prototyping, interactive visualizations, and responsive user interfaces. 💻

📊 The dataset for the model was collected from Kaggle, a popular website for data science and machine learning, providing a wide range of datasets. 📊

🌟 Additionally, I have incorporated images linked to the respective diseases. These images provide visual cues and make the app more engaging and informative. 📷
